This directory is used to generate the VHD ROM file for the Picoblaze Project.  
Write the software using the picoblaze assembly language in the lab6_starter.psm file.  
Then once ready to test, run the kcpsm6.exe and enter the file to process, which in this case is lab6_starter.psm.  
Assuming no errors in the assemlbly the tool will generate the lab6_starter.vhd file which can be imported into the Xilinx Picoblaze project to generate a new bitfile with the new software.
